## üìÇ Contents

### `feature_table_averaged.mat`
This file contains the primary processed dataset (`features_table_t2`) used for statistical analysis and figure generation. It includes a comprehensive set of kinematic and muscular features (e.g., velocity, acceleration, smoothness, range of motion, RMS EMG, co-contraction indices) segmented by condition and phase for healthy participants.

### `NASA_TLX_Dataset_Public.mat`
This file includes processed NASA-TLX questionnaire responses from all healthy participants and post-stroke individuals. It evaluates the perceived workload across experimental conditions, covering mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, effort, frustration, and perceived performance.

### `Perception_Questionnaire_Dataset_Public.mat`
This dataset contains responses to a custom perception questionnaire designed to assess feedback interpretability, reliance, responsiveness, comfort, and irritation during the VR tasks with different haptic feedback modalities.

### `oculus_features.mat`
This file contains Unity- and Oculus-derived features, including positional, rotational, and gameplay-related metrics extracted directly from the virtual environment during the tasks. These features provide insight into user interaction and behavior within the immersive VR game.
