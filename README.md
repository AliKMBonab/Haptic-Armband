# Leveraging Wearable Haptics for Guidance in Virtual Rehabilitation  
**Supplementary Dataset for Reproducibility**

This repository provides processed datasets used in the study:  
**"Leveraging Wearable Haptics for Guidance in Virtual Rehabilitation: Effects on Motor Control from an Immersive VR Setting"**

The goal of this repository is to support reproducibility and transparency of the analysis presented in the manuscript. It includes selected processed data used to generate figures and statistical results.

## üìÇ Contents

### `feature_table_averaged.mat`
This file contains the primary processed dataset (`features_table_t2`) used for statistical analysis and figure generation. It includes a comprehensive set of kinematic and muscular features (e.g., velocity, acceleration, smoothness, range of motion, RMS EMG, co-contraction indices) segmented by condition and phase for healthy participants.

### `NASA_TLX_Dataset_Public.mat`
This file includes processed NASA-TLX questionnaire responses from all healthy participants. It evaluates the perceived workload across experimental conditions, covering mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, effort, frustration, and perceived performance.

### `Perception_Questionnaire_Dataset_Public.mat`
This dataset contains responses to a custom perception questionnaire designed to assess feedback interpretability, reliance, responsiveness, comfort, and irritation during the VR tasks with different haptic feedback modalities.

## üìÅ Additional Data Availability

- **Muscle Synergy Analysis Results:**  
  Due to file size limitations, synergy decomposition results are not hosted here. However, the complete synergy datasets can be shared upon reasonable request.

- **Raw Data:**  
  Full raw EMG, IMU, and kinematic recordings used to generate the processed datasets are available upon a reasonable request for academic and non-commercial research purposes, in line with data protection and ethical guidelines.
